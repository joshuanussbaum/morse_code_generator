# morse code generator  
## a morse code generator built into chuck!  

HOW TO USE:  
* run initialize.ck inside miniaudicle, or in the command line by navigating to the morse_code_generator folder and typing `chuck initialize.ck`  
* the console should read out the letters and translations into morse code while playing out the sequence  
* once completed, the program will end and you will have a new file named "hello_morse.wav" in the morse_code_generator folder  
* to create your own morse code signals, replace the "Hello, World!" string labeled test with your own text, surrounded by quotes, and rename "hello_morse" to whatever you want the file to be named. run initialize.ck again.  


PLANNED FEATURES:  
* full morse code library, including ä, á, å, Ch, é, ñ, ö, and ü  
* sanitized data entry  
* live user text entry  


HOPEFUL FEATURES:  
* reverse translation - feed this program audio of a morse code signal and it will return a translated string of text  
* web-application version  
* multiple language support  
* farnsworth timing for novices  


TODO:  
* algorithm optimization  
* better variable naming
